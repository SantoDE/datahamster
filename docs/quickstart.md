# Quickstart

Datakube is a lightweight solution to get your cloud based data secured. There are 2 different image versions:

- datakube/server:dev
- datakube/server:0.1

The same applies for the agent:
- datakube/agent:dev
- datakube/agent:0.1

**:dev** will be become updated regularly with every merge to master while the second aproach is always linked to a fixed
version / tag.

## docker-compose
There is an `docker-compose` based example [here](../examples/docker-compose.yml).
